=============================== Description:
in this ex we did two parts one was to build a diagnoser class which can preform all kind of 
diagnosic presichers.
exemple of shuch is diagnose what illnes you have accordingly to the diciesion tree 
it get and the symptomes the patiante have  ,path to illness which run recursivly in all the
path to illness and when arriving to to wanted illness it returns the path too illness which mean
treu false list acoordingly to what sympotomes the petiante had or hadnt to get to this diagnose.
The second part was a dicition tree builder which get some records and a bunch of symptoms the function 
create a 
  'tree ' which consisite in every depth the same symptomes and when ariiving to a lef in the graph 
the function looks what was the most commen illness for this path in symptomes and then place it in the right
leaf of the graph .
anther function called optimal tree is get a serten depth and the create all the tree for cominations
of symptoms in this depth and return the one with the lowest error rate cumpute accordingly to the diagnser class.
